# Vasudhaiva-Kutumbakam-Tourism
Welcome to our City Atlas
*************************************************************************************************

## Inspiration
>>While visiting a tourist destination, though we go through internet to search across tourist sites in the destination, we often fail to look at some rare tourist spots which aren't listed on the internet. While a local of that place can help us out, Internet doesn't provide us with necessary knowledge.

## What it does
>>So we propose our solution in our website that we will comply with any local guide agency of that place to collaborate with us and make their destination a more viable attractive one. Moreover, not just tourists visit our place, but also many people visit for educational purposes.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
